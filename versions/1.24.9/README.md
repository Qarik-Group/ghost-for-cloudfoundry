The project is maintained by a non-profit organisation called the **Ghost Foundation**, along with an amazing group of independent [contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/contributors). We're trying to make publishing software that changes the shape of online journalism.

# Hosting a live Ghost site

<a href="https://ghost.org/pricing"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/18662071/f30da886-7f18-11e6-90f2-42c0ade79fd1.png" alt="Ghost(Pro)" /></a>

The easiest way to deploy Ghost is with our official **[Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing/)** managed service. You can have a fresh instance up and running in a couple of clicks with a worldwide CDN, backups, security and maintenance all done for you.

Not only will it save you hours of maintenance per month, but all revenue goes to the Ghost Foundation, which funds the maintenance and further development of Ghost itself. So youâ€™ll be supporting open source software *and* getting a great service **at the same time**! Talk about win/win. :trophy:

## Self-Hosters

Other options are also available if you prefer playing around with servers by yourself, of course. The freedom of choice is in your hands.

# Theme Developers

If you are developing a Ghost theme for your own site or creating themes for others to use we recommend installing Ghost on your own local machine. Luckily we have a brand new Ghost CLI to make this really easy ðŸ˜„
